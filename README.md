# Foodles coding project backend

## Installation

You need to have docker and node installed to run this project.
- Run `$ yarn` to install dependencies
- Run `$ yarn start:dev:db` to start the database in docker image
- Run `$ yarn seed:db` to add some fake data in the database. See **scripts/seed-dev-db.js** if you want to modify the fake data inserted

- Run `$ yarn start:dev` to start the backend

You can also run `$ yarn test` to run the tests
